Sampling sought to include PLHIV with: Different durations of antiretroviral therapy use (three months minimum), varying levels of experience with HIV research or community organizing and abilities to share experiences in a group. We sought representation of different age groups and of the main groups affected by HIV in Quebec, that is: gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (62% of PLHIV in Quebec), people from HIV endemic countries (15%), heterosexual women (10%) and people who inject drugs (4%). Investigators arbitrarily decided that the Team would include a maximum of ten members, all adults, based in Montreal, Canada. To recruit, four Montreal-based community organizations, with which investigators had previously collaborated, and health professionals at the McGill University Health Centre displayed flyers or suggested potential members. Interested individuals (n = 19) contacted the project coordinator by phone. The project’s main objectives and general expectations (eg, to attend meetings) were then explained.","Several strategies were used to recruit PPI members. We (1) approached several individual PPI members who had participated in the initial focus groups or in the pilot study of the intervention; (2) mailed letters or invitations with information about the study to leaders in the HIV field, Community-based organisations, faith-based organizations, HIV medical care providers, and other service agencies to attend an informational meeting about the project; (3) reviewed an existing database of former advocates and PPI members who served on previous projects and mailed them the invitational letter; and (4) accepted referrals via word of mouth from colleagues and associates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ","As recruitment to the PROUD pilot study came to an end, participants contributed to discussions about the future research priorities for HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in the UK through participant involvement meetings via a webinar and teleconference. These were advertised through the study website, study newsletter and in study clinics. Their discussions helped to directly inform the development of a new funding application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ","\"Using informal individual interviews, finding out that our patients have different priorities than we do wasn't easy, but ultimately very rewarding.

Participants included 4 ALHIV, funders, implementers and researchers. The meeting started with ALWH sharing their experiences living with HIV, followed by a review of a background article and presentations from expert policy-makers, researchers, and programers. The remainder of the meeting centered on four working group discussions on the following topics: HIV testing and linking ALHIV to care; retaining ALHIV in HIV care; ALHIV adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieving viral suppression, and ALHIV transitioning to adult care and HIV self-management. Based on these discussions, 6 implementation science research questions were developed, later voted on and prioritized by all meeting participants.
