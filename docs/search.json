Often the chosen representatives are already experienced in PPI activities and they tend to have a good understanding of research processes and the disease area and have links with the patient community.

These discussions not only informed members but asked their opinion about research processes and concepts associated with the study. Their input often served to improve/validate data collection instruments and research results, and, more specifically, make decisions concerning the development of and the organization of patient engagement. Additionally, members were actively involved in the expansion of the I-Score Study into a broader research programme: they gained an advisory status on four subprojects of the Study and one of the PPI Team eventually became a co-author.

This group met through face-to-face meetings and teleconferences, every 6 months. The e-group elected 1 member to become the Trial Social Scientist to take notes during meetings and to be the main linkage between the researchers and the e-group. The Trial Social Scientist provided more regular PPI input and remained involved in trial management and oversight committees throughout the trial and had decision power. Gafos 2020\nPatients were recruited for a Participant Advisory Panel by the Protocol Advisor. They met on a weekly basis with the Protocol Advisor, who served as a liasion between the investigators and the Participant Advisory Panel and was part of the study management team. The Participant Advisory Panel performed its work independently of the program staff. They discussed issues of confidentiality, sexuality, drug and alcohol use, spitituality and positive coping measures and deletion of repetitive questionnaires, and were key during the recruitment process. Carey 1992\nIn the first year of Project Eban’s implementation, each of the 4 sites formed a local Community Advisory Board (CAB). Member recruitment took place during the first 6 months of the study. On average, each site’s CAB consisted of 13–19 stakeholders, including leaders of HIV/AIDS-related Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), hospital-based HIV/AIDS service providers, HIV/AIDS network leaders in minority communities, and CBOs that serve predominantly black communities.

Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) is the process whereby patients and members of the public work alongside researchers, from the definition of research priorities, grant writing, study conceptualization, research tool development, results interpretation, through to dissemination. Increasing evidence highlights how PPI can improve research in terms of patient relevant outcomes, project implementation, acceptability of the proposed intervention and participant recruitment and engagement. Further, funders and publishers increasingly require PPI as an integral part of a research project.\nAnd so does the Swiss HIV Cohort Studies (SHCS). For each SHCS nested project funding proposal, a description of how PPI will be applied in the proposed project is required.\nThis hands-on, easy-to-search, continuously growing online evidence map aims to help researchers implementing PPI in their own HIV research project.\nShare your examples of PPI with us via this template, and we will add them to this site.\nFeel free to contact us if you have any questions or comments.\n\nView the underlying mapping review that informed the creation of this evidence map"
