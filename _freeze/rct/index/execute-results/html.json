Sampling sought to include PLHIV with: Different durations of antiretroviral therapy use (three months minimum), varying levels of experience with HIV research or community organizing and abilities to share experiences in a group. We sought representation of different age groups and of the main groups affected by HIV in Quebec, that is: gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (62% of PLHIV in Quebec), people from HIV endemic countries (15%), heterosexual women (10%) and people who inject drugs (4%). Investigators arbitrarily decided that the Team would include a maximum of ten members, all adults, based in Montreal, Canada. To recruit, four Montreal-based community organizations, with which investigators had previously collaborated, and health professionals at the McGill University Health Centre displayed flyers or suggested potential members. Interested individuals (n = 19) contacted the project coordinator by phone. The project’s main objectives and general expectations (eg, to attend meetings) were then explained.\",\"Several strategies were used to recruit PPI members. We (1) approached several individual PPI members who had participated in the initial focus groups or in the pilot study of the intervention; (2) mailed letters or invitations with information about the study to leaders in the HIV field, Community-based organisations, faith-based organizations, HIV medical care providers, and other service agencies to attend an informational meeting about the project; (3) reviewed an existing database of former advocates and PPI members who served on previous projects and mailed them the invitational letter; and (4) accepted referrals via word of mouth from colleagues and associates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \",\"As recruitment to the PROUD pilot study came to an end, participants contributed to discussions about the future research priorities for HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in the UK through participant involvement meetings via a webinar and teleconference.

The meeting started with ALWH sharing their experiences living with HIV, followed by a review of a background article and presentations from expert policy-makers, researchers, and programers. The remainder of the meeting centered on four working group discussions on the following topics: HIV testing and linking ALHIV to care; retaining ALHIV in HIV care; ALHIV adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieving viral suppression, and ALHIV transitioning to adult care and HIV self-management. Based on these discussions, 6 implementation science research questions were developed, later voted on and prioritized by all meeting participants.                                                                                                                                              \"],[\"<a href='https://tinyurl.com/Lessard2019'>Lessard 2019<\\/a>    \",\"<a href='https://tinyurl.com/MottCAB2008'>Mott 2008<\\/a>       \",\"<a href='https://tinyurl.com/South2016'>South 2016<\\/a>        \",\"<a href='https://tinyurl.com/dkfbasel'>DKF Basel 1<\\/a>        \",\"<a href='https://tinyurl.com/Denison2017'>Denison 2017<\\/a>\\n\\n\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>Task<\\/th>\\n      <th>Strategy<\\/th>\\n      <th>Example for Strategy<\\/th>\\n      <th>Link<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"dom\":\"t\",\"initComplete\":\"function(settings, json) {\\n$(this.api().table().header()).css({'font-size': '13px'});\\n$(this.api().table().body()).css({'font-size': '12px'});\\n}\",\"columnDefs\":[{\"name\":\"Task\",\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\"Strategy\",\"targets\":1},{\"name\":\"Example for Strategy\",\"targets\":2},{\"name\":\"Link\",\"targets\":3}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[\"options.initComplete\"],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Study documents\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-833858bae20ddcdd1b46\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-833858bae20ddcdd1b46\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"Creation of study protocol & funding proposal                      \",\"Creation of study protocol & funding proposal                      \",\"Creation of study protocol & funding proposal                      \",\"Creation of study protocol & funding proposal                      \",\"Creation of study protocol & funding proposal                      \",\"Creation of informed consent process and informed consentform (ICF)\",\"Creation of questionnaires and other study tools                   \",\"Creation of questionnaires and other study tools                   \"],[\"One PPI representative co-creates or reviews          \",\"A group of PPI representatives co-create or review    \",\"A group of PPI representatives co-create or review    \",\"A group of PPI representatives co-create or review    \",\"PPI representatives provide a formal letter of support\",\"Reviewing by crowdsourcing                            \",\"A group of PPI representatives co-create and review   \",\"A group of PPI representatives co-create and review   \"],[\"A Protocol Advisor was involved.

Participants: HIV-positive mothers. Mothers consulted raised concerns about the amount of blood that was planned to be taken from mothers and their babies as detailed in the draft protocol. The mothers were asked to consider what would be an acceptable amount of blood to be taken for the purpose of the research. After the consultation, the protocol was amended to reduce the quantity of blood to be taken to a level that was acceptable to mothers but still adequate for laboratory analyses. Before data collection, the interviewers participated in a 2-week training course. Question guides were translated into the local language, Chichewa, and back-translated into English. All interviews and focus group discussions were audio-taped, simultaneously transcribed and translated verbatim into English by the interviewer directly after the interviews and focus group discussions were conducted, and then subsequently reviewed by investigators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \",\"PPI representatives wrote a letter of support for a project funding proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \",\"Community feedback on the informed consent process was collected by transforming the 20-page informed consent form into a series of interactive, plain-language, animated video modules, which were screened at an open public discussion. The modules were created by a local community-based organization that specializes in translating clinical science to lay audiences through creative products. The event was advertised via Facebook (295 followers) and Twitter (329 followers) accounts of our research group. We also distributed physical copies of the event flyers at both a local infectious disease clinic and a clinical research center. We additionally sent the event information to local HIV community engagement advocates. Importantly, we solicited the assistance of a community member known to our research group as a highly engaged local HIV advocate who had previously participated in crowdsourcing research conducted by our group.\\nAfter screening, the participants discussed which parts of the informed consent modules were easiest and most difficult to understand, what additional information they thought a trial participant should know (i.e. what was missing from the modules), and what additional formats would be useful for conveying informed consent information to potential trial participants. This discussion was guided by a facilitator. To obtain a sufficient participation to benefit from multiple perspectives, we offered attendance incentives of a $15 gift card per attendee and also provided lunch. Ultimately a total of 20 people participated in-person at the event.
