Sampling sought to include PLHIV with: Different durations of antiretroviral therapy use (three months minimum), varying levels of experience with HIV research or community organizing and abilities to share experiences in a group. We sought representation of different age groups and of the main groups affected by HIV in Quebec, that is: gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (62% of PLHIV in Quebec), people from HIV endemic countries (15%), heterosexual women (10%) and people who inject drugs (4%). Investigators arbitrarily decided that the Team would include a maximum of ten members, all adults, based in Montreal, Canada. To recruit, four Montreal-based community organizations, with which investigators had previously collaborated, and health professionals at the McGill University Health Centre displayed flyers or suggested potential members. Interested individuals (n = 19) contacted the project coordinator by phone. The projectâ€™s main objectives and general expectations (eg, to attend meetings) were then explained.\",\"Several strategies were used to recruit PPI members. We (1) approached several individual PPI members who had participated in the initial focus groups or in the pilot study of the intervention; (2) mailed letters or invitations with information about the study to leaders in the HIV field, Community-based organisations, faith-based organizations, HIV medical care providers, and other service agencies to attend an informational meeting about the project; (3) reviewed an existing database of former advocates and PPI members who served on previous projects and mailed them the invitational letter; and (4) accepted referrals via word of mouth from colleagues and associates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \",\"This study aimed to identify the lived experience research priorities for improving HRQL and identify interventions to support priority areas.
